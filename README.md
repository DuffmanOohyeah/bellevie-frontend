# Bellevie frontend tech test

1. First off launch a CLI in the root of this projects' directory.
2. To install packages, please run the command `npm install`.
3. Run the command `npm run dev`.
4. You can now view the results in the browser by visitng `localhost:3000`.
5. You should see a selection of worker cards -> all built with responsive css.
6. N.B. The `supportWorker` mock data object provided seemed incorrect (as all of the IDs were identical), so I corrected them using reassigned ascending IDs; otherwise some of the `visits` in the mock data object will have been orphaned.
